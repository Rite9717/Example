**A paraphrase or rephrase** 
***is the rendering of the same text in different words without losing the meaning of the text itself***.
~~More often than not, a paraphrased text can convey its meaning better than the original words~~.
<sub>In other words, it is a copy of the text in meaning, but which is different from the original. For example, when someone tells a story they heard, in their own words, they paraphrase</sub>
<sup>with the meaning being the same.[1] The term itself is derived via Latin paraphrasis, from Ancient Greek παράφρασις (paráphrasis) 'additional manner of expression'. The act of paraphrasing is also called paraphrasis</sup>
